## Note
- Some of the UI, such as pop-up windows, is currently in Japanese. An English version will be released in the future.
- The smaller the MoveAmount and the larger the RotateLimite, the longer the system monopolises control of the mouse. Please use caution when configuring the settings, as the escaping process is currently not yet implemented.
